# Perceptron
Perceptron Model for Mobile like/dislike predictor

This is a basic code for MP Neuron used for classification of a small dataset.

#About the Dataset.
The dataset has two files namely : train.csv and test.csv

#train.csv
It contains 99 columns referring to 98 features of a mobile a phone and the last column contains the rating of the mobile phone.

#test.csv
It contains 98 columns referring to 98 features of the mobile phone.

#About the code
As MP Neuron is a binary classification model, the rating have been converted to binary numbers using a threshold of 4. This means that if the rating of the mobile phone is greater than equal to 4, then the mobile is liked by the user else it is not liked.

Finally, based on the train data, MP Neuron is trained so that given the features it can predict whether a mobile phone will be liked by the user or not.
